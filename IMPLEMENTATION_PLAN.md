## Questions / Decisions Needed

1. **Storage Method**: Which storage method do you prefer for processing history?
   - JSON files (simple, no dependencies)
   - MongoDB (if already set up)
   - SQLite (lightweight, structured)

2. **History Retention**: How long should we keep processing history?
   - 30 days?
   - 90 days?
   - Forever with manual cleanup?

3. **Email Preview Format**: Should the preview show:
   - Plain text version?
   - Rendered HTML?
   - Both?

4. **Filter Behavior**: Should filters:
   - Apply to all future processing?
   - Be optional per-processing job?
   - Apply retroactively to history?
